A break out game created in Java

Features of Game:

* Use the slider to hit blocks until all of the blocks are finished.
* Sprites: Green coloured blocks are special blocks that the user can hit which elongates the slider making it easer to hit the ball.
* Special Blocks: There are special blocks (different colour) that the user can hit multiple times to gain more points.
* Pause - players can pause at any time during the game to read the instructions again.
